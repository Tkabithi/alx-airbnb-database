# Seed Data

This folder contains SQL scripts to populate the Airbnb-like database with sample data.

- `seed.sql`: Inserts sample users, properties, bookings, payments, reviews, and messages.
- The data simulates real-world usage with multiple users (guests, hosts, admins), bookings, and interactions.
